<div class="NOTE">
<p>This document is a short tutorial that aims to introduce you to a
typical UNIX-like environment, as the one you can find on CSIF
computers.</p>
<p>Make sure to read it if you don’t feel comfortable using the
terminal, connecting remotely to other UNIX computers using SSH,
etc.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="preamble">Preamble</h1>
<p>In the early 1970s, pioneering engineers at AT&amp;T Bell Labs began
developing a small operating system that they called
<strong>Unix</strong>. Initially written entirely in assembly language,
it was rewritten a couple of years later in a new high-level language,
especially developed for the occasion by the same group of engineers,
called <strong>C</strong>. This programming language switch enabled Unix
to be easily portable to new computer hardware, which reinforced its
already growing popularity.</p>
<p>Because AT&amp;T was not yet authorized to sell Unix directly as a
product, Unix started to be licensed to outside parties from the late
1970s. Throughout the 1980s, many academic and commercial variants of
Unix were harshly competing: amongst the strongest competitors (with
their own Unix variants) were UC Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM
(AIX) and Sun Microsystems (Solaris).</p>
<p>In parallel, Richard Stallman from the MIT started the GNU project,
which aimed to create a completely free and Unix-compatible operating
system. By the early 1990s, the project already counted numerous
fundamental software components, many of which we will use in this
class, including a C compiler (gcc), a debugger (gdb), a C standard
library (libc) and dozens of other utilities. The only missing part, to
make a complete operating system, was the <em>kernel</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in the summer of 1991, a Finnish student named Linus
Torvald began developing his own kernel, which he later called
<strong>Linux</strong>, and made it available for anyone to use and
modify. It sparked a huge interest from the community and by the
mid-1990s, the Linux kernel combined with the GNU components and other
tools could be distributed as a complete and functional operating
system.</p>
<p>Today, existing Unix-like (aka <strong>*nix</strong>) operating
systems embrace:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handful, mostly closed-source, commercial survivors directly
derived from the original AT&amp;T Unix, such as AIX, Solaris or
HP-UX.</li>
<li>Some open-source and free distributions based on UC Berkeley’s BSD
branch, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD.</li>
<li>Mac OS X, which also derive from the BSD branch and for which some
parts of the operating system are open-source.</li>
<li>All open-source and free GNU/Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="csif-at-uc-davis">CSIF at UC Davis</h1>
<p>The <strong>CSIF</strong> (Computer Science Instructional Facility)
runs a network of about 40 computers, physically located in the basement
labs of Kemper Hall. They are currently installed with <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>, one of the most
popular GNU/Linux distributions, in its 22.04 LTS version.</p>
<p>Almost all of these computers are accessible to students registered
for computer science classes at UC Davis. For this class, the CSIF
computers are considered the <em>reference environment</em> in which
your assignments will be graded.</p>
<p>In case of issue of if you have any questions regarding CSIF, you can
go to the support office located in Academic Surge, room 1114, or write
an email at <a href="mailto:support@cs.ucdavis.edu">support@cs.ucdavis.edu</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the CSIF on their <a href="http://csifdocs.cs.ucdavis.edu/">website</a>.</p>
<h1 id="logging-in">Logging in</h1>
<p>If you are a CS major or are taking a CS class, you should
automatically get a CSIF account which enables you to log into any of
the CSIF computers. To access your account, you need to know your UC
Davis Kerberos username and password (that is the same username/password
you are using to access your email account).</p>
<p>There are two options to log into the CSIF computers:
<em>locally</em> in the basement labs, or <em>remotely</em> from your
own computer and through the network.</p>
<h2 id="local">Local</h2>
<p>Physically go to one of the basement labs in Kemper Hall. The labs
are located in rooms 67, 71 and 75. Choose a computer that is available
and appears to be working. Enter your username and password at the login
screen. If everything goes well, the desktop environment should be
loaded and you can start running applications.</p>
<p>In order to start a <strong>terminal</strong>, click on the menu (top
icon in the left sidebar), search for <code>terminal</code> and open the
terminal application. The terminal is the window in charge of the
graphical display. Internally, it runs another (non-graphical)
application called the <strong>shell</strong> which processes input
commands.</p>
<p>The shell shows a command line <strong>prompt</strong> indicating
that it’s ready to receive commands and execute them. Such prompt
usually shows your username, computer name, the path to the current
working directory and ends with the character <code>$</code>. On the
same line as the prompt you can type in a shell command and press
<em>Enter</em> to execute it.</p>
<h2 id="remote">Remote</h2>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<p>Because of many attacks over the summer of 2020, the College of
Engineering has put the CSIF behind a VPN.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in the following page in order to set up a
VPN connection on your computer: <a href="http://csifdocs.cs.ucdavis.edu/news/vpnrequiredtoconnecttocsifcomputers" class="uri">http://csifdocs.cs.ucdavis.edu/news/vpnrequiredtoconnecttocsifcomputers</a></p>
</div>
<p>The CSIF computers are remotely accessible through the network via a
protocol called SSH (<em>Secure SHell</em>). The computers you are
authorized to access are named <code>pc01</code> to <code>pc43</code>.
You can view the real-time status of all these computers on this <a href="http://iceman.cs.ucdavis.edu/nagios3/cgi-bin/status.cgi?hostgroup=all">page</a>.
Pick a computer to which you would like to get connected (take a
computer noted as “UP” in the status report since computers noted as
“DOWN” are not reachable).</p>
<p>Each of these computers are publicly accessible from outside campus
through their full public address. Such address is obtained by appending
<code>.cs.ucdavis.edu</code> to the computer’s name. For this tutorial,
we choose computer named <code>pc42</code> which full public address is
then <code>pc42.cs.ucdavis.edu</code>.</p>
<p>If your computer runs a GNU/Linux distribution or if you have a Mac
computer running Mac OS X, then the SSH software is probably already
available. If your computer is running Windows, jump down to the related
paragraph in order to install the necessary software.</p>
<h3 id="gnulinux-or-mac">GNU/Linux or Mac</h3>
<p>In order to connect to computer <code>pc42</code>, open a terminal
window and at the shell prompt, type in the following command. Note that
<code>&lt;user&gt;</code> has to be replaced by your Kerberos
username.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ssh<span class="w"> </span>&lt;user&gt;@pc42.cs.ucdavis.edu
</pre></div>

<p>If you have never connected to the computer before, SSH will ask if
you are sure of the computer’s authenticity:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">The authenticity of host &#39;pc42.cs.ucdavis.edu (128.120.211.123)&#39; can&#39;t be established.</span>
<span class="go">ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:bzT3S4HdKczDmnkim5BdxfTig9LRgxd8ipT7DulO8xg.</span>
<span class="go">Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In such case, type in <code>yes</code> in order to continue
connecting. Once the authenticity of the computer is established, SSH
will prompt you for your password on the remote computer. Enter your
Kerberos password.</p>
<p>Once you are connected to the remote computer, you should have access
to a shell prompt and be able to enter commands.</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>Since Windows does not come with SSH installed, you need to download
and install an SSH client yourself. <strong>PuTTY</strong> is an
open-source SSH client that can be downloaded from this <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">page</a>.
Install one of the MSI installers, or just grab one of the
<code>putty.exe</code> binary executables.</p>
<p>When running PuTTY, a dialog window will appear. Enter the full
public address of the computer to which you would like to connect
(e.g. <code>pc42.cs.ucdavis.edu</code>) in the <code>Host Name</code>
box. Make sure that the <code>Port</code> is set to <code>22</code>, and
that the protocol is set to <code>SSH</code>. If you wish, you can save
this configuration for later use by entering a descriptive name
(e.g. “CSIF - pc42”) in the <code>Saved Sessions</code> box and clicking
<code>Save</code>.</p>
<p>Now click on <code>Open</code> at the bottom of the dialog, in order
to start the connection. If you have never connected to the computer
before, PuTTY will display a <code>PuTTY Security Alert</code> dialog
box that asks if you trust this host. Click <code>Yes</code> to
accept.</p>
<p>After entering your Kerberos username and password, you should be
connected to the remote computer, have access to a shell prompt and be
able to enter commands.</p>
<h1 id="navigating-the-file-system">Navigating the file system</h1>
<h2 id="absolute-pathname">Absolute pathname</h2>
<p>Each directory has an <strong>absolute pathname</strong> that
uniquely specifies the location of that directory within the computer’s
file system. As you move within the directory structure, you can use the
command <strong>pwd</strong> in order to display the absolute pathname
of the <em>current</em> location. The pwd command actually stands for
“print working directory”.</p>
<p>Type <code>pwd</code> in the shell now. It should display
<code>/home/&lt;user&gt;</code>, with <code>&lt;user&gt;</code> being
your Kerberos username (e.g., <code>/home/jporquet</code>). This
directory is your <em>home directory</em>. This is the place where your
data are located in a typical *nix file system. Each user has their own
home directory that is completely under their control.</p>
<h2 id="change-directory">Change directory</h2>
<p>The command <strong>cd</strong>, which stands for “change directory”,
allows you to move to any other accessible directory in the file system.
The syntax for cd is: <code>cd [path_name]</code>. Now, change to the
<code>/bin</code> directory by typing <code>cd /bin</code>. After
executing this directory change, use pwd to confirm that you now are in
the <code>/bin</code> directory.</p>
<h2 id="list-files">List files</h2>
<p>The command <strong>ls</strong>, which stand for “list”, allows you
to see the contents of a directory. The syntax for ls is:
<code>ls [-al] [pathname]</code>, where the square brackets (“[]”)
indicate optional values. For now, simply type <code>ls</code>.</p>
<p>You will see a list of all the file names that are included in the
<code>/bin</code> directory. This directory holds many of the basic *nix
utilities, some of which you will get to discover later in this tutorial
or during this quarter. Note that command <code>ls</code> is listed, but
command <code>cd</code>, for example, is not: this is because ls is an
independent application, while cd is a built-in command provided
directly by the shell.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>
<p>Before you dive into the options of ls, go back to your home
directory. You could type <code>cd /home/&lt;user&gt;</code> (e.g.,
<code>cd /home/jporquet</code>), but there is a better shortcut. Simply
type <code>cd</code>, it will bring you back to your home directory
automatically.</p>
<p>After the shell has executed the change directory command, confirm
that you are back inside your home directory with pwd. Now type
<code>ls</code>. If you have not created any files or directories in
your account so far, then nothing will be displayed.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-files">Hidden files</h2>
<p>Many shell commands have <em>options</em> that may follow the command
after a space and a dash. Options are used to modify the command’s
behavior. For <code>ls</code>, the options change what you see – giving
you specialized types of information which you would not see using the
basic command.</p>
<p>Now type <code>ls -a</code>. The <code>-a</code> option stands for
“all”. Here is a possible output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ls<span class="w"> </span>-a
<span class="go">.               .bashrc</span>
<span class="go">..              .cache</span>
<span class="go">.bash_history   .ssh</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The reason you didn’t see these files before specifying the
<code>-a</code> option is that their name start with a period which
turns them into <em>hidden</em> files. Such files are hidden because
they are often configuration or data files belonging to applications and
were not directly created by the user.</p>
<p>In the listing, there are two unusual entries: <code>.</code> and
<code>..</code>. These entries have a special meaning in terms of
pathnames. <code>.</code> stands for the current directory while
<code>..</code> stands for the parent directory.</p>
<p>Type <code>cd .</code> followed by <code>pwd</code>. As you can
notice, you have not moved within the directory structure. Now, type
<code>cd ..</code> followed by <code>pwd</code>. You should see
<code>/home</code>, which means you changed to the parent directory.</p>
<h2 id="long-format-listing">Long-format listing</h2>
<p>Now return to your home directory using cd, and type
<code>ls -al</code>. The <code>-l</code> option stands for “long”, and
will make ls display a line of information for each entry. Here is an
example of possible output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ls<span class="w"> </span>-al
<span class="go">total 996</span>
<span class="go">drwxr-xr-x     3 jporquet users   4096 2017-11-13 09:13 .</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Here is a brief introduction to the information displayed in the long
format (from left to right):</p>
<ul>
<li>File type and file permissions field
<ul>
<li><code>drwxr-xr-x</code>
<ul>
<li>The <code>d</code> at the very left indicates the entry is a
directory.</li>
<li>The next group of three letters <code>rwx</code> indicates that the
owner has <em>read</em>, <em>write</em> and <em>execute</em> permissions
for this entry. For a directory, the execute permission means that I can
cd into that directory. Read permission means that I can use ls to see
the directory’s contents. Write permission means that I can create
additional entries (subdirectories or files) into this directory.</li>
<li>The next two groups of three show that users of the group named
<code>users</code> as well as other users not beloning to that group,
are only allowed read and execute permissions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>-rw-r--r--</code>
<ul>
<li>The dash at the very left indicates the entry is a regular
file.</li>
<li>Here the read and write permissions mean the ability for the owner
to look at the file (e.g. using commands like <strong>less</strong> as
shown later) or to edit the file (e.g. using a text editor such as
<strong>vim</strong>).</li>
<li>Other users can only look the file’s content but not modify it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Links field: number of links to this entry from other
directories</li>
<li>Owner field: name of owner</li>
<li>Group field: name of group</li>
<li>Size field: file size in bytes</li>
<li>Date field: date stamp at which the file was last modified</li>
<li>Name field: entry’s name</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="root-directory">Root directory</h2>
<p>So far, we haven’t specified any pathname after ls. This caused the
contents of the current working directory (as reported by pwd) to be
listed. But if you indicate a pathname after the command, you will see
its contents instead. Type <code>ls /</code> in order to see all the
files and directories that are contained in the file system’s root
directory.</p>
<p>The <em>root</em> directory (represented by a sole slash,
<code>/</code>) is the top directory in the *nix file system structure,
and thus contains all the files and directories of the system. You can
notice that it contains the <code>home</code> subdirectory, which holds
the home directory of all the users.</p>
<h1 id="directories">Directories</h1>
<h2 id="create">Create</h2>
<p>In order to create a new directory, use the <strong>mkdir</strong>
command, which stands for “make directory”. Its syntax is
<code>mkdir {dirname}+</code>, where the curly brackets followed by the
plus sign indicate that there must be at least one directory name
specified.</p>
<p>Now type <code>mkdir first</code>, followed by <code>ls -l</code>.
You should see a new directory named <code>first</code> in the file
listing. Now type <code>cd first</code> to move into directory
<code>first</code>. Use pwd to confirm where you are.</p>
<p>Now type <code>mkdir second third</code>, followed by
<code>ls -a</code>. The output should display:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>.  ..  second  third
</pre></div>

<p>Now type <code>ls -l</code>, and the output should display:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 jporquet users 4096 2017-11-17 02:48 second
drwxr-xr-x 2 jporquet users 4096 2017-11-17 02:48 third
</pre></div>

<h2 id="delete">Delete</h2>
<p>The command <strong>rmdir</strong>, which stands for “remove
directory”, allows you to delete an empty directory. Its syntax is
<code>rmdir {dirname}+</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>rmdir second</code> to remove the directory named
<code>second</code>. Confirm that the directory was removed using
<code>ls</code>. You should now see only <code>third</code> being
listed.</p>
<h1 id="files">Files</h1>
<p>Use pwd to make sure that you are still in
<code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/first</code>.</p>
<h2 id="copy">Copy</h2>
<p>There a two possible syntaxes for the <strong>cp</strong> command,
which stands for “copy”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>cp {source_filename} {destination_filename}</code>, to make a
copy of the source file into the destination file</li>
<li><code>cp {source_filename}+ {destination_directory}</code>, to copy
a list of files into another directory</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will copy an existing file into the current directory. Type
<code>cp /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3 myfile</code>.</p>
<p>Use ls to confirm that the file was properly copied under the name
<code>myfile</code>. The only other entry should be directory
<code>third</code>.</p>
<p>Now copy this file into directory <code>third</code> by typing
<code>cp myfile third</code>. You could check that the file copy was
successful by cd’ing into the <code>third</code> directory and then
using ls but there is a simpler way. Just type <code>ls third</code> in
order to display the contents of the <code>third</code> directory. You
should see only <code>myfile</code> listed.</p>
<h2 id="move">Move</h2>
<p>The command <strong>mv</strong>, which stands for “move”, has three
possible syntaxes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>mv {old_filename} {new_filename}</code>, to change the name of
a file</li>
<li><code>mv {filename}+ {directory_name}</code>, to move files into
another directory</li>
<li><code>mv {old_directory_name} {new_directory_name}</code>, to change
the name of a directory</li>
</ol>
<p>You will try all three methods in order.</p>
<p>Now type <code>mv myfile wombat</code> to rename file
<code>myfile</code> into <code>wombat</code>. Use ls to check your work:
you should see only directory <code>third</code> and file
<code>wombat</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>mv third/myfile .</code> in order to move file
<code>myfile</code> to the current directory. Again, use ls to verify
that the current directory now contains directory <code>third</code> and
files <code>myfile</code> and <code>wombat</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>mv third fourth</code> to rename directory
<code>third</code> into <code>fourth</code>. Use ls to see directory
<code>fourth</code> and files <code>myfile</code> and
<code>wombat</code>.</p>
<h2 id="delete-1">Delete</h2>
<p>The syntax of the command <strong>rm</strong>, which stands for
“remove”, is: <code>rm {filename}+</code>.</p>
<p>Type <code>rm myfile</code> and use ls to check that file
<code>myfile</code> was removed, leaving only directory
<code>fourth</code> and file <code>wombat</code>.</p>
<h1 id="command-line-interface">Command-line interface</h1>
<p>By default, your CSIF account is set up to use the very popular shell
<strong>Bash</strong>. This shell comes with many features that can
greatly help improve the command line workflow.</p>
<h2 id="edition">Edition</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine you wish to copy file <code>wombat</code> into
directory <code>fourth</code>, but you mistakenly type
<code>cp woombat forth/</code>. Fortunately, <strong>before</strong> you
hit the return key to execute the command, you notice your errors.</p>
<p>You can go back to make the appropriate changes by using the
<em>left</em> and <em>right</em> arrow keys to move within the command
line. You can then correct both errors, adding the missing
<code>u</code> in <code>forth</code> and deleting the extra
<code>o</code> in <code>woombat</code>.</p>
<p>When you are done correcting the command line, you can press enter to
execute the command.</p>
<p><em>Note that the cursor does not need to be at the end of the
command line to press enter.</em></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Each time a command is entered, it is added to the shell’s history,
which contains a list of all the previously entered commands. You can
scroll backward through previous commands by entering the key
combination <code>&lt;Ctrl-p&gt;</code> or by using the <em>up</em>
arrow key. Inversely, you can scroll forward with key combination
<code>&lt;Ctrl-n&gt;</code> or by using the <em>down</em> arrow key.</p>
<p>When you go back to a previous command, you can either just execute
it again by pressing enter or edit it using the <em>left</em> and
<em>right</em> arrow keys.</p>
<p>If you know approximately the command you would like to go back to,
you can also press key combination <code>&lt;Ctrl-r&gt;</code>, which
invokes a reverse interactive search. Start typing part of the command
and you will get the most recent command of the history that matches
your input.</p>
<h2 id="completion">Completion</h2>
<p>In order to save typing and time, Bash gives the possibility to
complete the various parts of a command.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you wish to move file <code>wombat</code> into
directory <code>fourth</code>. The command would be
<code>mv wombat fourth</code>. However, rather than typing the whole
command, you can start typing <code>mv w</code> and then hit the
<code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code> key. Since file <code>wombat</code> is the only
file in the current directory that starts with the letter
<code>w</code>, Bash can complete its name for you. You can then
continue entering the command by typing <code>f</code> and hit
<code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code> again. Since <code>fourth</code> is the only
item starting with an <code>f</code>, Bash can also complete its name,
eventually giving the complete command
<code>mv wombat fourth/</code>.</p>
<p>As you can notice, completion saved 50% keystrokes in this case (16
keystrokes for the full command vs. 9 keystrokes when using
completion)!</p>
<p>If several files start with the same letters, Bash might not be able
to complete a entire filename based on your partial input. In this case,
Bash will try to complete as much as possible and will then wait for you
to enter one or more letters in order to choose between the different
possibilities. When Bash is waiting for extra characters in order to
solve the ambiguity, press <code>&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;</code> in order
to list the completion possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>There are several utilities that can be used to display file
contents.</p>
<p>In order to display one or several files directly in the terminal,
you can use the <strong>cat</strong> command, which stands for
“concatenate”. Its syntax is: <code>cat {filename}+</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>cat wombat</code> and observe how the contents of the
file just flew by on the screen.</p>
<p>For short files, cat might be fine, but often you will wish to see
the file progressively. For that, you can use the command
<strong>less</strong>, a <em>pager</em> application allowing you to
scroll through a file. Its syntax is <code>less {filename}+</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>less wombat</code>. You will see that only a
screen-worth of the file is displayed, starting from the beginning of
the file. Less shares a lot of shortcuts with <strong>vim</strong>. To
scroll forward one line, you can either use the <em>down</em> arrow or
press <code>j</code>. To scroll up, use the <em>up</em> arrow or press
<code>k</code>. To quit, press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can happens that you want to either see the first few
lines or the last few lines of a file. For that, you can respectively
use the command <strong>head</strong> or the command
<strong>tail</strong>. Their syntax is:
<code>head/tail [-n] {filename}+</code>, where option <code>-n</code> is
the number of lines to be displayed (default is 10).</p>
<p>Now type <code>head -4 wombat</code> to see the first four lines of
file <code>wombat</code>. Type <code>tail -1 wombat</code> to see the
last line of file <code>wombat</code>.</p>
<h1 id="process-killing">Process killing</h1>
<p>In most shells, including Bash, it is possible to send special
commands to the shell itself using key combination based on the
<code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</code> key. We have seen that key combinations
<code>&lt;Ctrl-p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Ctrl-n&gt;</code> can be used
to scroll through the command history.</p>
<p>Another very important key combination is
<code>&lt;Ctrl-c&gt;</code>. It can be used to instantly terminate the
process that is currently being executed by the shell.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>ping</strong> utility checks the
availability of a remote computer by sending periodical <em>ping</em>
requests that the remote answers (or not if it’s down). By default, this
utility never stops by itself and continues to send ping requests until
it’s interrupted by <code>&lt;Ctrl-c&gt;</code>. The syntax of the
<code>ping</code> utility is <code>ping {computer_address}</code>.</p>
<p>Now type <code>ping google.com</code>. Your screen will start filling
with lines indicating the quality of the network connection between your
current host and <code>google.com</code>. Terminate the process by
pressing <code>&lt;Ctrl-c&gt;</code>. Ping should display a few lines of
statistics after it has received your interrupt signal, and you should
get back to the shell prompt again.</p>
<p>You can use <code>&lt;Ctrl-C&gt;</code> in most situation when a
command or a process seem to be stuck or perform in an unsatisfactory
manner.</p>
<h1 id="text-editors">Text editors</h1>
<p>Although terminals can only offer text-based user interfaces, they
still permit to use some of the most powerful text editors for writing
programs. Three popular text-based editors available on CSIF computers
are <strong>Nano</strong>, <strong>Emacs</strong> and
<strong>Vim</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nano is by far the most simple and less powerful text editor; it
is only recommended for small and quick file edits.</p></li>
<li><p>Emacs is the official text editor of the GNU project and is
characterized by its extensibility. It offers a graphical user interface
when being used locally, but can revert to a text-based interface when
being used in the terminal (over SSH for example).</p></li>
<li><p>Vim (and by extension, <strong>Vi</strong>, the original text
editor of which Vim is a improved clone) has the advantage of being
available on almost every *nix computer. It is also known as the other
contender in the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs/Vim war</a>.
Although Vim only runs in the terminal, <strong>Gvim</strong> offers a
graphical user interface when used locally.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended to learn how to use a powerful text
editor, such as Vim or Emacs, as it would surely increase your
productivity. (As well as making you feel like a real hacker!)</p>
<p>For example, in order to get started with vim, type
<code>vimtutor</code> in a terminal and follow the tutorial
entirely.</p>
<h1 id="manual-pages">Manual pages</h1>
<p>In *nix systems, commands are traditionally thoroughly documented
using manual pages that are accessible through the <code>man</code>
command. For example, in order to know more about ls, you can type in
<code>man ls</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a small portion of what you will get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about  the  FILEs  (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file
<span class="p">.</span><span class="s">..</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, a <em>man page</em> always starts with a very short
description of the command and a summary of its syntax. It is typically
followed by other sections including the detailed list of all possible
options.</p>
<p>As man typically uses the pager less to display its output, the same
shortcuts are available to scroll through the documentation
(<em>down</em> and <em>up</em> arrows, or <code>k</code> and
<code>j</code>) or to quit (<code>q</code>).</p>
<div class="TIP">
<p>Since a command’s manpage is typically meant to be a comprehensive
documentation for that command, it can often be a bit overwhelming.
There is another tool called <code>tldr</code> which condenses the usage
of a command in a few, well-chosen examples. Type <code>tldr ls</code>
to see the examples associated to using <code>ls</code>.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="logging-out">Logging out</h1>
<p>You can now log out from the CSIF computer, as explained below, and
resume a normal activity!</p>
<h3 id="local-1">Local</h3>
<p>Close the terminal by typing <code>exit</code> at the shell prompt.
Close any other running applications. Click on the gear icon located at
the far right of the top panel and select “Log Out…”. The computer
should log you out and return to displaying the initial login
screen.</p>
<h3 id="remote-1">Remote</h3>
<p>In the terminal window, at the shell prompt, type in
<code>exit</code>. If you are running PuTTY on windows, this should
close PuTTY entirely. If you are running a terminal on GNU/Linux or Mac
OS X, it should simply close the connection with the remote CSIF
computer but leave the terminal window open. You can either close the
window or type in <code>exit</code> again in the terminal to close
it.</p>
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>
<h2 id="other-typical-nix-commands">Other typical *nix commands</h2>
<p>There are many (powerful) command line utilities that you might find
useful at some point during the quarter. Read their manual page in order
to understand how to use them.</p>
<p>Here is a small list:</p>

<h2 id="run-gnulinux-in-a-virtual-machine">Run GNU/Linux in a Virtual
Machine</h2>
<p>If you are using Windows or Mac OS X and would like to easily run
GNU/Linux on your local computer, a simple solution is to run it in a
<em>virtual machine</em>. A virtual machine emulates a full computer
system, thus allowing to run a complete Operating System in an
application window.</p>
<p><strong>Important: keep in mind that only the CSIF computers are
considered as the reference environment for this class. If it works on
your computer but not on the CSIF computers during grading, you will not
receive points.</strong></p>
<p>There are few tutorials that explain the procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox">Ubuntu on
Windows</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/07/how-to-set-up-ubuntu-linux-on-a-mac-its-easy-and-free/">Ubuntu
on Mac</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://goo.gl/jd88un">CSIF tutorial</a></p>
<p><em>Warning: at this time, the tutorial is out of date, as it refers
to Ubuntu 16.04!</em></p>
<p>This tutorial, written by Jim Moersfelder from the CSIF, explains how
to install the software VMWare on Windows and run almost the same Ubuntu
system as the one running on the CSIF computers.</p>
<p>This tutorial might be a bit difficult to follow for the complete
beginner. Also, although it focuses on VMWare for Windows, just know
that it could work on other systems as long as your virtualization
software is compatible with <code>vmdk</code> files.</p></li>
